# FUTURE_CS_02 – Security Alert Monitoring & Incident Response

## Internship Track
Cyber Security – Future Interns

## Task Objective
The objective of this task is to analyze Linux authentication logs to detect
security alerts such as brute-force login attempts and classify the incident
with appropriate response actions.

## Log Source
- Linux Authentication Logs
- Source Dataset: loghub-master.zip
- Log Type: SSH authentication failure logs

## Methodology
- Analyzed authentication logs manually
- Identified repeated failed login attempts
- Classified the attack type based on log patterns
- Prepared an incident response report

## Findings
- Over 300 failed authentication attempts
- Multiple SSH login failures from external IPs
- Pattern indicates brute-force SSH attack

## Incident Classification
- Incident Type: Brute Force Attack
- Severity Level: High
- Target Service: SSH Authentication

## Tools Used
- Linux authentication logs
- LogHub dataset
- Manual log analysis

## Deliverables
- Incident Response Report (DOCX)
- Log dataset (ZIP)
- GitHub Repository

## Conclusion
This task helped me understand how authentication logs are analyzed in SOC
environments to detect brute-force attacks and respond to security incidents.
